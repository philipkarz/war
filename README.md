##Aproach Taken
1. Began with 2 separate arrays for each player
2. Used a shuffle function to randomize players cards
3. Made a click function for each card
4. Made a checkWinner function to keep track of score
5. After 2 cards are chosen they flip back over
6. Created a countdown of 30 seconds which then declares the winner
7. Made restart game function
7. Added sound and css animations 


##Unsolved problems
- The css/html layout could use some more work
- Would have liked to make the game more interactive, give players the ability to choose moves and fight eachother
- Wanted a card flip animation when player clicks a card
